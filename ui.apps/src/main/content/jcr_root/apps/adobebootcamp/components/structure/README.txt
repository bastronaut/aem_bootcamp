Files in this folder are automatically generated by the maven Archetype. These remain here to serve
as examples because they contain a number of examples of how to perform common AEM related actions, such as:
- Adding client libs to your component
- Creating a page component with partial html files using data-sly-include
- Creating a seperate structure for your navigation
- ... etc

However, for the purpose of our bootcamp, the Pages and their structure are stored 1 level up under /components/pages
